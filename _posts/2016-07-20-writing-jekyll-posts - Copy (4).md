Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

A full review of dressing-room culture is part of a wide-ranging action plan to tackle discrimination and racism in cricket in England and Wales.

It has been issued following allegations made by Azeem Rafiq and a number of other players.

The ECB will also form a new anti-discrimination unit within six months.

Last week, former Yorkshire spinner Rafiq told a Digital, Culture, Media & Sport select committee the English game is "institutionally racist".

Rafiq's allegations against the county have been echoed by former academy player Irfan Amjad and another anonymous player.

Jahid Ahmed, Maurice Chambers and Zoheb Sharif have also made claims about their time with Essex.

Sports minister Nigel Huddleston said the government could take the "nuclear option" of creating an independent regulator if the ECB does not "put its house in order" over racism.

"The last few weeks have been very, very tough," said ECB chief executive Tom Harrison. "It feels like an earthquake has hit us.

"Our game has been portrayed in the worst possible way in the world's media. Azeem's testimony and testimony from others has revealed serious issues which we have collectively not dealt with for many decades.

"There are clearly large numbers of people in the country who feel like cricket has not been there for them. This is our latest attempt to say we are listening and we are desperate to solve the problem."

The action plan, jointly published by the ECB, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Professional Cricketers' Association, 41 counties, women's regions and recreational network is described as a "game-wide response to discrimination".

The 12 actions each fall under one of the five points, as follows:
