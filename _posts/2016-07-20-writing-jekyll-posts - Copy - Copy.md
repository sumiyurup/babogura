Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

A simple salmon pasta that’s ready in under 15 minutes. This recipe makes two generous servings or three lighter meals. It’s also very easy to double up.

Based on two servings, each serving provides 869 kcal, 37g protein, 58g carbohydrates (of which 5g sugars), 52g fat (of which 21g saturates), 7g fibre and 1.2g salt.

Method
Half fill a large pan with salted water and bring to the boil. Add the pasta and cook for 7–12 minutes, or according to the packet instructions until just tender, stirring occasionally. Three minutes before the end of the pasta cooking time, add the broccoli to the water and cook with the pasta for 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium non-stick frying pan and cook the spring onions, or sliced onion, for 1–3 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly.

Add the salmon pieces and chilli, if using, and cook for about a minute, turning the salmon 3–4 times. Add the cream and a ladleful of the pasta cooking water (around 100ml/3½fl oz). Season generously with salt and pepper.

Bring to a gentle simmer and cook the salmon for 3–4 minutes, turning occasionally (add an extra splash of water if the sauce thickens too much.) Drain the pasta and broccoli and return to the pan. Add the creamy salmon sauce and lemon zest and toss together lightly.
