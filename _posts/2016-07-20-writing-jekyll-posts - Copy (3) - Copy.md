Today’s school leavers have lived through a time like no other, with Covid-19 bringing lockdowns, home-schooling, cancelled examinations, assessed grades and delayed university places. Not only have they been forced to switch the classroom for the kitchen table, but looking ahead to their careers, the sands of economies are shifting like never before.

Industries that are certain to grow in importance, however, are those taking steps to help mitigate climate change. The urgency of the planet’s plight comes in the form of daily reminders of raging wildfires and deadly floods. The youngest generations stand to be the worst affected and now fluent in social media, they are able to share their opinions and fears.

They need to be supported with tools and resources in the classroom, says Christopher Graham, a teacher, educator and writer. “Climate references can be embedded into most school subjects, geography, history, science for example and also languages,” says Graham. “Students can discuss the crisis in a new language.” He suggests, in addition to climate-change specific lessons, environmental issues can be woven into daily lessons, with age-appropriate discussions and topics. “Children can see how climate issues fit into their world,” Graham says. Schools could begin teaching students early about the scale of the crisis, he says. “This is a crisis that impacts on us all, and that we can all – regardless of age – do something about,” Graham says.

Change is afoot. New Zealand has introduced climate change studies into its secondary school curriculum, while in Spain it is compulsory in primary and secondary education, and other countries including Argentina and Mexico are looking to follow. In Italy, former education minister Lorenzo Fioramonti last year championed a law which made Italy the world's first country to make climate study compulsory in schools. China also integrates climate topics into its English language teaching materials.

There are tools available for teachers to help students better understand climate change, while navigating the danger of eco-anxiety. For instance, through the British Council’s Climate Connection platform educators can access various lesson plans, podcasts and videos to help improve climate literacy from primary to school-leaver age. There are also free courses for anyone wanting to learn about sustainability via a MOOC (massive open online course) created by the University of Edinburgh.

Another teacher championing classroom collaboration on climate change is Muhammad Jahid Reza, a lecturer at Joypurhat Girls’ Cadet College in Bangladesh. Reza works with female students aged 13-18 on projects around water pollution, deforestation, air pollution and earthquakes. As a British Council International School Award Co-ordinator, Reza has arranged four online collaborations with schools from India, Nepal and Taiwan on topics such as climate change and the greenhouse effect.

His students have also made videos on climate change and its effects, such as droughts and floods. “My students realised that if we are affected badly by any of those climatic disasters, it's going to affect the nation, as geographically we're in a vulnerable position,” he says.

Reza says the class motto is: “We don't compromise when we build our homes, why should we compromise when building the home for our homes?”
